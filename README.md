# 🌐 Hardware Components – Educational Website

This project is a static educational website designed to explain the fundamental hardware components of a computer: the processor (CPU), graphics card (GPU), and storage solutions (RAM, HDD, SSD). The site is built to be visually engaging and easy to understand, especially for beginners interested in computer technology.
